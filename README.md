Mohan Artificial Intelligence (MAI)
=======================================

Welcome to the first official repository of MAI. We aim to push forward the AI realm using [Unreal Engine](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine)
as tool. More information about the Engine is [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/feed). 

Curret Aim: To explore the prospects of AI (both academic and non-academic) in the Engine

Meanwhile you can relish on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0lqbgiEOC4) of the AI agent shooting colored boxes based on Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

Progress (August 4, 2019)
MAI now demonstrates successful implementation of Reinforcement Learning using Behavior Tree. For more information read [blog-post](https://ravimohan.net/2019/08/03/b-for-behavior-blackboard-and-brain-3/)

Next, explroing the scope of learing nodes in Behavior Tree as written in [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02312).
